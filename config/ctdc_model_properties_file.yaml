      agent administered to a participant as a targeted therapy, i.e. one that is considered
      to have enhanced therapeutic effects upon the specific type of cancer with which
      the participant has been diagnosed, and/or upon that type of cancer specifically
      within the context of a given participant because of factors such as tumor histology,
      grade, gene expression and genetic make-up. Notably, a therapeutic agent considered
      to be and administered as a targeted therapy in one participant based upon the specifics
      of such characteristics can, conversely, be considered and administered as a
      non-targeted therapy in another participant, because of differences in his or her
      type of cancer per se, or the specific context of the cancer in question. <br>CDE
